# AtlasProject_MentalHealth

When technology develops rapidly, the economy keeps growing. When people are enjoying a better and better material life. Does everyone feel happy? Sometimes we need to go back to people and focus on our spiritual side. What makes me think about this is When searching for all sorts of health data, I was struck by the steady increase in suicide rates in recent years. Let people have the courage to give up their precious lives. They must be suffering and struggling inside. What is behind the proportional increase in suicide rates? There are many reasons. What reminds me most is people's mental health.

> “Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.” (Source: mentalhealth.gov)

Mental health issues are important in addition to their impact on people's lives and physical. It is a type of disease that is often overlooked. Some of its subtle symptoms are not easy to be found by family and friends around. Its early symptoms include, eating or sleeping too much or too little, pulling away from people and usual activities, having low or no energy, feeling numb or like nothing matters, having excessive aches and pains, hopeless or hopeless, etc. Mental health problems are a common problem. It can be treated and rehabilitated.

The atlas suggests relationship between these possible factors and mental health from multiple perspectives. Possible factors include poverty, unemployment, medical facilities, and exercise habits. There are many types of mental health problems. And it is not just mental problems that cause people to commit suicide. But suicide is the worst consequence of the most serious mental health problems. The atlas extends data on suicide rates to mental health issues, showing some possible data and geographic distribution related to mental health, and hypothesis whether these possible factors are somehow related to suicide rates. The atlas includes information on suicide mortality rates in the us states, whether income affects people's mental health, whether the states with the highest unemployment rates have serious mental health problems and thus high suicide rates, and how health facilities and sport help mental health.

Based on data on suicide mortality rates in the United States, the map shows the distribution of high and low suicide rates in each state. New York state has the lowest suicide death rate. Wyoming has the highest data. It was followed by a detailed analysis of medical, sport facilities in New York City and Wyoming. It seems to illustrate that good medicine facilities contributes to people's mental health. Good exercise habits have a positive impact on mental health. While the figures are subject to error and there is no comparison of the number of medical treatments, the population base of the two states is dramatically different. But you can still draw some rough conclusions visually. Then, the atlas shows the distribution of poverty and unemployment. Trying to figure out how they relate to suicide rates. The map showing the distribution and rates of poverty suggests that there is no direct link between poverty and mental health. Nor is unemployment a factor in mental health problem.

#### The choropleth map shows the suicide mortality rate in each state in the United States in 2018. It was produced by QGIS. The data comes from the CDC website. Age-adjusted Death Rates refer to the number of deaths per 100,000 total population. Although adjustments for differences in age-distribution and population size, rates rankings by state do not consider other state specific population characteristics that may affect the level of mortality. When the number of deaths is small, rankings by state may be unreliable due to instability in death rates. This map reflects the states with the highest and lowest suicide death rates in the United States.

#### Based on a map of suicide mortality rates, Wyoming had the highest suicide figures, while New York had the lowest. This is a HTML Document. The map highlights Wyoming and New York by JavaScript uses the Polygon feature to pull Wyoming and New York from a plethora of states and data to make them visible and added a pop-up window to show the data, as I will specifically show maps of these two very different states. This map makes my atlas coherent and logically consistent. The data is also from the CDC, resources from Leaflet, used by OpenStreet Basemap.

#### The dot density map of New York State. It shows medical facilities in New York State (purple dots) and sports facilities (yellow dots). It was produced by QGIS. The data comes from Mapcruzin.com. The first map, suicide mortality, shows that New York has the lowest figure of almost any state in the United States. This map data shows New York's very intensive medical and sports facilities. It seems to illustrate that good medicine contributes to people's mental health. Good exercise habits have a positive impact on mental health. Although the data are subject to error, there are no specific medical comparisons. But it still points out a lot of relevant information.

#### The dot density map of Wyoming. It shows Wyoming's medical facilities (blue dots) and sports facilities (yellow dots). It was produced by QGIS. The data comes from Mapcruzin.com. The first map, suicide mortality rates, shows Wyoming has the highest of almost any state. It is the opposite of what happened in New York state. But according to the logic of an earlier block map of New York State, does Wyoming have very rudimentary medical care? Indeed, the map data indicates that Wyoming has far fewer medical and sports facilities than either New York state or some states in general. Although New York has a large population. The comparison is not absolutely accurate. But it fits with the idea that good medical and sports facilities contribute to people's mental health.

#### The choropleth map shows the average distribution of poverty in the United States between 2017 and 2019. The map was produced by QGIS. Data from U.S. Census Bures. I still compare the distribution of poverty and suicide mortality. Wyoming was the state with the lowest poverty rate, according to the map. The data is biased, but Wyoming's poverty rate does not appear to be high. It suggests that there is no direct link between poverty and mental health.
